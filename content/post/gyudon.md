Inspired by Yoshinoya. Classic beef bowl simmered in a fish flavored stock. Alternatively, can turn this into a tender beef stew complete with carrots and potatoes with pressure cooker.

## Ingredients for Beef Stew
* 2 tsp canola/avocado oil
* 2 onions, sliced into 1/2" half moons
* 1 lb beefsteak, sliced (from Trader Joe's)
* 2 Tbsp sugar 
* 1/2 cup dashi (1 tsp of powder in 1/2 c water)
* 3 Tbsp mirin 
* 2 Tbsp sake (use rice vinegar instead)
* 4 Tbsp soy sauce 
* 2 teaspoons fresh ginger, grated 
* 2-3 gold potatoes, cut into 2 inch pieces (too small and they will overcook)
* handful of baby carrots

## Notes
* 11/29/18 - Made double recipe as written on [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/pressure-cooker-nikujaga/) but with noodles omitted. May try to add noodles next time. Regardless, was underseassoned so rewrote recipe above to increase soy and add ginger as in beef bowl, below.

## Instructions for Beef Bowl
1. Parboil the beef in hot water until little pink remains. Drain.
2. Add sake, mirin, soy sauce and sugar to a skillet. Turn on the burner and stir the mixture on medium heat.
3. When it starts to sizzle, add the beef. Toss to coat evenly.
4. Before the liquid evaporates too much, turn off the burner and remove the beef.
5. Reheat the skillet and add the water, dashi stock powder, grated ginger and onion to the mixture. Stir lightly and cover.
6. When the liquid boils, reduce the heat to low and cook for about 5 more minutes. Remove the lid.
7. Mix in the beef.
8. Serve over rice.

## Notes 
* Inspired by [Cooking With Dog's Gyudon](https://cookingwithdog.com/recipe/gyudon-beef-bowl/)
* Problem I have is that the beef is never as tender as I like, or as fatty as hubs likes. Different cut of meat perhaps?
