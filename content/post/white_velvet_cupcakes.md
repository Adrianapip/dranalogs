A tender, white cake that has excellent flavor potential both on its own and with flavor additions.  

<!--more-->

I'm a pie and pastry person. It's always worked out in the past as my husband always requests pie for his birthday. It doesn't really work for my children's birthdays though - I think it'd be weird to make a unicorn pie or construction-themed tart.

So I've been on the hunt for a reliable and customizable recipe. I've found a good one. It's from Rose's Heavenly Cakes. Doesn't surprise me since her Pie and Pastry Bible taught me pretty much all I know about making the best pies. 

This recipe checks all the boxes:
<br>

- [x] can be made and frosted a day ahead without sacrificing texture or freshness (whatever superparent has time to make AND frost cupcakes the day of a child's birthday party :bow:)

- [x] can be easily modified for flavor (sprinkles = funfetti cake; lemon oil/zest = lemon cake; almond extract = almond cake)

- [x] can be easily modified for color; its pure white color is a blank canvas for all those fun colored cake gels

- [x] does not leave a pool of grease in the bottom of the cupcake tins; i.e., this is a light and airy cake but surprisingly moist as well

:alarm_clock:: 2 hours <br>
:cake:: makes about 12-14 cupcakes

## Instructions

PREP:
Get the eggs and butter to room temperature. I find that eggs are easier to seperate cold, but it can be done with room temp eggs. 

1. Place rack in lower third position in oven and preheat convection/standard 350 degrees F.

2. Line cupcake pan with 12-14 liners.

3. In small bowl, gently mix egg whites, milk, and vanilla.

4. In bowl of stand mixer with paddle attachment, mix sifted flour, sugar, baking poweder and salt for 30 seconds on low speed. Add the butter and until just combined. Turn speed up to medium and beat for 1.5 minutes. Scrape bowl.

5. Turn mixer to medium low and add half the egg mixture. Beat for 30 seconds. Add the rest of the egg mixture and beat for another 30 seconds. Scrape bowl. Batter will look a little broken, but that's ok. (Overbeating will result in collapsed cupcakes.) 

6. Using a #30 scoop, add approximately 45 grams of batter to each cup. Will look about 2/3 full. 

7. Bake for 18-20 minutes convection or 20-25 minutes standard.

8. Rest cupcakes in pan for 10 minutes on cooling rack, then remove cupcakes from pan. Allow to cool completely before frosting/storing.

9. Frost with Swiss Meringue Buttercream. 

Storing: Keep in an airtight container unfrosted overnight at room temperature or overnight. Can frost the night before you need them. Or, you can frost them and keep them in an airtight container refridgerated the night before you need them. Serve at room temp. 

## Modifications:
* For lemon cake, add 1 tsp of lemon oil and 1.5 tsp of lemon zezt in place of vanilla extract
* For funfetti, fold 1/4 cup of colored jimmies to the batter after step 5. The resulting cake is still quite good, but I've found that the sprinkles add a bit of "chalkiness" to the batter. Sounds gross now that I type it but kids could care less. Sprinkles >>> Chalkiness in their book.
