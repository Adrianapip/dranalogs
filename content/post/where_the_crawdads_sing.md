### What I enjoyed:

This was my first read from Reese's book club. It's been making the rounds amongst the bookstagrammers I follow, and the high ratings on amazon prompted me to purchase the ebook since the library wait list was too long.

I needed a compelling and easily digestible storyline to transition me to reading again. Since taking a break from a heavy reading phase during the third trimester of my last pregnancy, I've not been able to read more than 5 minutes at a time. 

The story had flavors of Barbara Kingsolver with naturalist themes as it pulled from the marshland setting in North Carolina. The plot was focused on a young girl's coming-of-age interestingly woven into a tidy, little murder-mystery.  

The author is a wildlife biologist with non-fiction books but it's pretty amazing that this is her first fiction.

### What I didn't enjoy:

The ending was a little predictable. If you pay enough attention, a trail is laid with slices instead of the more suspenseful breadcrumbs. 

There are overly simplistic analogies between animals and humans (e.g. the author continually compares animal mating rituals, such as male bird plumage, with human interaction.) Effective for the writing a relatable story I suppose, but it both anthropormorpizes animals and simplifies human behavior.

<br>

### Overall:

Reese's book club has been around for only a year but this was my first pick. It was good enough in many ways that I am tempted to add the others to my library hold list. 

As for the author, would definitely consider other books from her in the future.
