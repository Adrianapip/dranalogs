Usually I apple-cider wet brine my turkey, but this year since I have a prime rib as a backup protein, I decided to try dry brining. The result was much easier as there's no need to keep a water logged turkey in the fridge. In addition, the it was deliciously moist (even the breast meat) and had a great turkey flavor.

## Ingredients
### Turkey and Brine
* 12-15 lb turkey (this year, used 13 lb Mary's Free Range)
* 6 TB of Morton's kosher salt


### Herb Butter




#### Notes:
* General recipe from [Serious Eat's Simple Roast Turkey](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/11/the-best-simple-roast-turkey-gravy-recipe.html)
* I also followed the directions on (applying baking powder/skin to the skin)[https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/10/how-to-get-crispier-chicken-turkey-poultry-skin-with-baking-powder.html] and applying salt underneath the skin. The result was not worth the effort since I also ended up using an herb butter, which eventually softened the skin. The herb butter was super tasty and would use again, but baking powder method may be worth the effort for just plain chicken for weeknight meal.
