Needed a pork chop recipe that's dairy-free (sorry beloved cream of mushroom soup) and *not dry*. This one is suitable for a pressure cooker or slowcooker/closed pot stovetop if time permits.

* 3-4 pork chops (bone in or out)
* 3/4 cup AP flour
* 2 large yellow onions, sliced 
* 1 cup chicken broth (if using powder watch salt)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 tsp white pepper
* 1 TB brown sugar
* 1 tsp seasame oil
* generous pinch of five spice powder
* 1 TB shaoxing wine (optional)
* salt to taste
* 1.5 TB of cornstarch in cooked broth
