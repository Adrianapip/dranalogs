### My thoughts:

I typically read exclusively on kindle but picked up this doorstop biography during one my Costco runs.  Glad I did because this book was meant to be read on paper. The pages are thick in order to include Leonardoâ€™s works and detailed journal entries/sketches. 

The journal entries were the most facinating component. So much so that I'd be interested in owning a book that has nothing but translations of his entries for my musings. 

There are apparently thousands of handwritten pages exploring theories, inventing machines, and illustrating dissected human bodies.  

As someone with no liberal arts background, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Da Vinci and his art. One take away message from this biography is the breadth and depth that is possible from one curious mind left to wander. Genius is not only something one is born with, but can be attainable by decades of hard work and dedication.
