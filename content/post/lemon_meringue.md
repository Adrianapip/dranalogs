A lemon pie with the perfect ratio of sweet meringue to tart filling in a flaky shortcrust pastry. 

<!--more--> 

This recipe requires correctly assembling three major components: crust, filling, and then meringue. I have issues with most lemon pies and recipes - the filling is not fresh tasting, the meringue is overly sweet or syrofoam-like, and the crust is often flavorless. 

This recipe is a combination of sources to make, what I think, is the tastiest, most proportional lemon meringue pie. The filling is smooth as silk, the meringue is gooey (and cooked to a safe 175 degrees), and the crust is buttery and flaky.

## Crust Instructions

1. Cut butter in small cubes (3/4 in), place in freezer for about 30 minutes
2. Place flour, salt and sugar in food processor, pulse to mix
3. Add 1/3 frozen butter and pulse until completely combined
4. Add the rest of the butter, pulse until butter becomes size of small lima beans. Use a fork through the flour to gauge the size of the butter pieces.
5. Add ice water/vinegar and pulse until most of the butter is the size of large peas and dough just comes together.
6. Pour dough onto plastic wrap and knead slightly with heel of your hand, folding over dough a couple times.
7. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refridgerate for at least 45 minutes.
8. Preheat oven to 425 for at least 20 minutes. 
9. Roll out pastry and line pie pan. Place into freezer to rest until oven comes to temperature.
10. Line pastry with parchment paper, and fill with dried rice or beans, making sure the sides are supported with weight.
11. Turn oven down to 400, bake for 20 minutes, then remove paper and weights, prick the dough gently, and bake for 5-10 minutes more.
12. Immediately brush with egg white to seal the crust.


## Filling Instructions
1. In a small bowl, whisk egg yolks
2. In heavy saucepan, combine cornstarch and sugar. Gradually whisk in water until smooth.
3. Cook over low heat, whisking constantly until smooth and translucent.
4. Allow to slowly boil for a few minutes. This activates the cornstach and thickens the filling by evaporating some water. Remove from heat.
5. Plop a few spoonfuls of cooked cornstach mixture into egg yolks, whisking constantly to bring the eggs up to temperature. (i.e., temper the egg yolks)
6. Add warmed egg yolk mixture, salt, lemon zest, lemon juice and butter to the saucepan, whisking until smooth and beautifully yellow.
7. Pour into prepare pie crust and cover with plastic wrap to keep warm.
8. Preheat the oven to 350.


## Meringue Instructions

1. Fill a wide pot with at least 1 1/2 inches of water, with a thick ring of crumpled tinfoil placed inside to act as a "booster seat." Place over high heat until steaming-hot, then adjust temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. 
2. Combine egg whites, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer. 
3. Set over steaming water, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites hold steady at 175°F (79°C), between 8 and 10 minutes. 
4. Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed until meringue is glossy and beginning to ball up inside the whisk, about 5 minutes. 

## Finalizing the Pie

1. Spread the meringue atop the filling, using the crust to anchor the merigue.
2. Bake the pie for 5 minutes.
3. Turn on broiler and let the pie brown for about 1 minute.
4. Cool the pie for at least 3 hours before serving.
