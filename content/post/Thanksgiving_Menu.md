![2018 Thanksgiving](/2018_thxgiving.jpg#center)

<br>

This meal took from Sunday to Thursday to prepare, with a little effort on Thanksgiving day. Because of my double ovens and starting early on Thursday, I was able to make both a prime rib and turkey. I could see this being done with one oven though, if you start with the prime rib and allow it to rest while the turkey is cooking.

<br>

Notes for next year: Need to redo the "Gameday timeline", perhaps into a table format that is easier to read, or a hourly timeline.
