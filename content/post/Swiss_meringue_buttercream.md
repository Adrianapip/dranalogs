My staple buttercream for cupcakes. 
<!--more-->

This is a great recipe because it: 

- [x] isn't gritty like American buttercream (the butter + powedered sugar type);
- [x] holds shape at room temperature; read: can withstand sitting out at a kid's birthday party;
- [x] can be made ahead of time (see storage notes below);
- [x] takes flavoring well, such as lemon, strawberry, chocolate, etc;
- [x] safely cooks the meringue to 185°F. I don't mess around with food poisoning + kids.


:alarm_clock:: 30-45 minutes <br>
:cake:: makes about 6 cups; enough for 24 cupcakes


| Ingredients               | Volume    | Weight |
|---------------------------|-----------|--------|
| egg whites, from 5-6 eggs | 2/3 cup   |  170g  |
| sugar                     | 1 2/3 cup |  310g  |
| kosher salt               | 3/4 tsp   |    -   |
| cream of tartar           | 1/4 tsp   |    -   |
| unsalted butter, @ 65°F | 5 sticks  |  565g  |
| vanilla extract           | 1 tsp     |    -   |


## Instructions

1. Get ready: take butter out of fridge to get it to ~ 65°F.

2. Fill a wide pot with at least 1 1/2 inches of water, with a thick ring of crumpled tinfoil placed on the bottom to act as a "booster seat" that will prevent the bowl from touching the bottom of the pot. Place over high heat until steaming-hot, then adjust temperature to maintain a gentle simmer.

3. In a stand mixer combine egg whites, sugar, salt and cream of tartar.

4. Set the mixing bowl over steaming water in its booster seat, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites hold steady at 185°F, about 10 to 12 minutes.  

5. Transfer to the mixer with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed about 10-15 minutes, until meringue is glossy, stiff, and cool to the touch, around 90°F. 

6. With mixer still running, add butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time. Initially, the volume of the meringue will decrease dramatically; it may even seem soupy along the way, but as the cool butter is added, the mixture will begin to thicken and cool. In the end, buttercream should be thick, creamy, and soft but not runny, around 72°F. Place in the fridge for about 15 minutes if needed to decrase the temperature to get the right consistency.
NOTE: Sometimes I don't use all the butter, like I'll have half a stick leftover because I feel like the butter flavor is just coming through too strong. Taste and see along the way.

7. Mix in vanilla extract on low speed until well combined.

#### Storing: 
I almost always make my buttercream ahead of time because it stores quite easily in the fridge (about 2 weeks) or freezer (several months). I like to use [these containers](https://www.amazon.com/Reditainer-Storage-Containers-32-Ounce-24-Pack/dp/B00M9Z4SV6?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_2) as they hold one batch of this buttercream perfectly. I just place a layter of saran wrap on top so the buttercream isn't exposed to air. Rewarm to 72°F and re-whip before using.
