## Equipment

* I use this [1-lb loaf pan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YKGRKU/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with excellent results - good browning, even cooking.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Grease loafpan with nonstick cooking spray or butter, if using (use the leftover wrapper!)
3. In stand mixer on medium low, combine fat (either coconut oil or butter) and sugar. Increase speed to medium and mix until homogenous and lighter in texture, about 5 minutes.
4. In a medium measuring cup, combine bananas and lemon juice, set aside.
5. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt, set aside.
6. To the stand mixer, add one egg at a time to sugar/fat mixture, beating for 20 seconds on med-low after each addition.
7. Add flour mixture to stand mixer, beat on med-low until combined for about one minute.
8. Add banana-lemon juice to stand mixer, beating just until combined.
9. Stir in nuts, if desired.
10. Pour into greased loaf pan. Bake for approximately one hour, or until toothpick comes out clean. This is a dense loaf and will take the entire hour, sometimes 1 hour and 15 minutes depending on the quantitiy of bananas in your loaf.


## Notes 

* Original recipe uses margarine. Have used coconut oil and butter with good results.
