Inspired by favorite curry dish at Savoy. Very hearty and beef heavy. A step up in spice from massaman curry.

## Notes 

* To make it like Savoyâ€™s add cartelized shallots to rice. Family also likes a side of steamed broccoli with this dish.
* The chuck will be somewhat shredded, ribs intact, be sure to put about half the volume of veggies otherwise it is very beef heavy dish.
* Also can use 3 tb yellow curry paste and 1 tb Indian curry powder - somewhat spicier
* Inspired by [beef brisket curry](http://delishar.com/2016/11/beef-brisket-curry.html)
