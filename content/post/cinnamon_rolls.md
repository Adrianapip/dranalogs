## Ingredients

TANGZHONG (STARTER)

* 71g water
* 71g 2% milk
* 28g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour

DOUGH

* all of the tangzhong (above)
* 496g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour
* 21g nonfat dry milk
* 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
* 1 tablespoon instant yeast
* 170g lukewarm 2% milk
* 2 large eggs
* 85g unsalted butter, melted
* 1 TB sugar

FILLING

* 213g brown sugar
* 6 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 2 TB corn syrup
* 2-3 TB water

ICING

* 227g confectioners' sugar
* pinch of salt
* 28g melted butter
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 43g cream, enough to make a thick but spreadable frosting


## Instructions

1. To make the tangzhong: Combine all of the starter ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.
Place the saucepan over medium heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan. This will probably take only a minute or so. Remove from the heat, and set it aside for several minutes.

2. To make the dough: Mix the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients until everything comes together. Let the dough rest, covered, for 20 minutes; this will give the flour a chance to absorb the liquid, making it easier to knead.

3. After 20 minutes, knead the dough — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a smooth, elastic, somewhat sticky dough. Using the mixer will take abou 8 minutes to get a smooth dough. Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.

4. To make the filling: Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, corn syrup and water, mixing until the cinnamon is thoroughly distributed to make a paste.

5. Gently deflate the risen dough, divide it in half, and shape each piece into a rough rectangle.

6. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into an 18" x 8" rectangle.

7. Sprinkle half the filling over the rolled-out dough.

8. Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a log. With the seam underneath, cut the log into 12 slices, 1 1/2" each.
Repeat with the second piece of dough and the remaining filling.

9. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Space the rolls in the pan. (3 X 6 arrangement)

10. Cover the pan and let the rolls rise for 45 to 60 minutes, until they're crowding one another and are quite puffy.

11. While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to convection 350°F with a rack in the bottom third.

12. Uncover the rolls, and bake them for 22 to 25 minutes, until they feel set. They might be just barely browned; that's OK. It's better to under-bake these rolls than bake them too long. Their interior temperature at the center should be about 188°F.

13. While the rolls are baking, stir together the icing ingredients, adding enough of the milk to make a thick spreadable icing. The icing should be quite stiff, about the consistency of softened cream cheese.

14. Remove the rolls from the oven, and turn them out of the pan onto a rack lined with parchment paper. Spread them with the icing; it'll partially melt into the rolls.

15. Serve the rolls warm. Store completely cool rolls for a couple of days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 1 month.

### 12/1/18 
* The rolls came out ok, but could have done more in terms of lightness and fluffiness - I only did the first proof for 30 because it seemed like it has risen double. Used the warming drawer - next time will increase the proofing time, because it seemed like the second proof took 1:20 mins instead of 45-60 as noted. 
* Used 2% milk as that is what we had, which probably resulted in the less moist bun. 
* Took the buns out at 20 mins at 350 convection, and the buns seemed slightly underdone I
* Used a reviewer's rec to 1.5x the icing and added 2TB of corn syrup, it made a paste but it was unspreadable and made a lot of goo that seemed to fall out when inverting the pan after baking. Makes also a pretty dark bun on top because it's covered in the cinnamon mixture. Next time will try a butter spread.
* also the recipe makes quite a bit of icing - for family may make half as much but for display/guests make the whole recipe.
* the dough is not very sweet. May experiment with more sugar next time. 

## 12/15/18
* Made a half recipe, added 1 TB sugar to dough.
