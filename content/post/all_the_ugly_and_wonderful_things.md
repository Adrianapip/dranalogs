INTENT + AUDIENCE = CONTENT + TONE
Intent: Informative, bit of persuation (pursuade, motivate, entertain, inspire)
Audience: Book readers (very clear about your audience, do they have existing knowledge of subject, what are their values, do you understand them? hit a nerve? - this helps in writing in being precise )
Content: what are your points you want to make (basic unit of writing)
	1. Jot down things you want to say
	2. Dont worry about order

Tone: Chatty (witty, poigont, authoritative)
Pace: (fast - not bore them or slow - funeral speech, want to celebrate a life)

Points:
- engaging from the start, gets a running start by decribing the oddities of the characters
- characters were complex and I felt for them
- storyline was interesting, it feels like it should be wrong (immoral) but you feel like rooting for their sucess
- writing was seamless, I flew through the book
- multi-narrative style worked - mutliple cameras on a single scene got me wanting to know each person's perspective/observations on a scene
- From a parental standpoint some scenes were hard to accept - moments of child abuse and neglect
- the ending didn't get as much attention as the beginning - there 75% of the book was describing the childhood, the last 25% or so focuses on moving the main character to adulthood

### What I liked:

All the Wonderful and Ugly Things is engaging from the first few pages. It begins with the description of  a young girl named Wavy as she suddenly appears at her Aunt's house. Along with the question as to how and why she got there all alone, her cousins describe her as extremely aloof and excitingly strange. She sneaks out at night to steal food from neighbors' refridgerators. She resists any type of affection or touching. She hardly speaks but when she does, it's in breathy, labored sentences. 

Reading about Wavy is like secretly watching a feral cat in your backyard sneaking around and hiding. Hunting for something to eat. It's strangley addicting.

And then, it moves to her point of view. 

One thing I really like is that the book switches between all different character's perspectives in the book. It's the reading equivalent filming from every angle that produces a 3-D view of a scene. (like the ones they use in football games) That way you get all these angles from which to see what is going on - what each person is thinking - not just one view. 

The storyline was interesting. There were parts that felt like they should be wrong (as in immoral) but at the same time, I felt like rooting for them at the end. I feel like it's good writing when you know what the characters are doing is immorrally wrong, but you end up rooting for them anyway (kinda like Breaking Bad or Dexter) 

### What didn't work for me:

I get mixed emotions with this book. It was a tough read. 

As a mother, it's hard to read about stuff about drug addicted parents and child abuse and neglect. 

Although I felt the book itself was bordering on being too long, I felt the ending was rushed - it certainly tied up all the loose ends but it didn't seem to match the storytelling details of the initial part of the book.

There are only a few books that hit me in the gut similiarly (off the top of my head - A Little Life).
