### ...the name of this site:

* "Drana" = my childhood nickname
* "Logs" = collected anecdotes from my various hobbies, which currently include 
	baking, 
	reading, and 
	gardening

### ...why this site exists:

* To create an organized, search-able, central repository of collected anecdotes currently scattered around my brain/house
* To learn how to build a static website from scratch
* To build an easily retrievable recipe database so I don't repeat mistakes
* To remember all the books I've read and what I've learned from them

### ...my recipes:

* I follow a scientific rule of thumb used in research for my recipes: sharing what I believe to be reproducible and robust through my own findings.
* That being said, if I'm experimenting with a recipe, I will note that, i.e. YMMV

### ...the books I read:

* Literary fiction
* Historical fiction
* Non-fiction, particularly science non-fiction

### ...me:

* An East Coast turned California girl (I still go back every Christmas to smell and feel the snow) 
* I have 3 clones = :boy::girl::baby:
* An INTJ
* My background is in biochemistry/molecular biology/microbiology; I'm currently interested in bioinformatics, genomics, and digital health technologies
