### ...the name 'dranalogs':

**"drana"** = my childhood nickname  
**"logs"** = collected anecdotes from my hobbies, which currently include:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:cake: baking,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:book: reading, and   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:seedling: gardening

### ...why this site exists:

* To create an organized, search-able, central repository of thoughts and ideas currently scattered around my brain/house
* To learn how to build a static website from scratch
* To build an easily retrievable recipe database so I don't repeat mistakes
* To remember all the books I've read and what I've learned from them

### ...my recipes:

* I post recipes that have repeatedly worked in my kitchen.
* That being said, if I'm experimenting with a recipe I will note that, i.e. YMMV
* In baking, weighing is more accurate. Most my recipes have been converted to include metric weights.

### ...the books I read:

* Literary fiction
* Historical fiction
* Non-fiction, particularly science non-fiction

### ...me:

* An East Coast turned California girl (I still go back east every Christmas to smell and feel the snow) 
* My human incubation powers have yielded --> :boy::girl::baby:
* A happy INTJ
