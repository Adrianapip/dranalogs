A sweet almond biscotti balanced by tart cherries.

:alarm_clock:: 2 hours <br>
:cookie:: makes about 30 cookies


## Ingredients
* 180g (1 1/2) cups all-purpose flour 
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
* 1/4 teaspoon salt 
* 69g cornmeal or 1/2 cup semolina flour
* 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
* 1 cup sugar 
* 2 large eggs 
* 1 1/2 teaspoons pure almond extract 
* 3/4 cup sliced almonds, blanched or unblanched
* 3/4 cup dried cherries


## Instructions

1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to convection 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

2. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together. Add the semolina and whisk again to blend.

3. Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together at medium speed for 3 minutes, until very smooth. (Can use Keller's method to get butter to mayonaisse consistency)

4. Add the eggs and continue to beat, scraping down the bowl as needed, for another 2 minutes, or until the mixture is light, smooth and creamy. 

5. Beat in the almond extract. 

6. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients, mixing only until they are incorporated. You'll have a soft stick-to-your-fingers dough that will ball up around the paddle or beaters. 

7. Scrape down the paddle and bowl, toss in the almonds and mix just to blend.

8. Scrape half the dough onto one side of the baking sheet. Using (wet) fingers and a rubber spatula or scraper, work the dough into a log about 12 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Be carefil not to give the long sides pointy ends as these can cook faster. Form a second log with the remaining dough on the other side of the baking sheet.

9. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the logs are lightly golden but still soft and springy to the touch. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and cool the logs on the baking sheet for 30 minutes.

10. If you turned off the oven, bring it back up to 350 degrees F.

11. Using a wide metal spatula, transfer the logs to a cutting board. Lay them on one side and slide sheet back into oven.

12. Bake the biscotti for about 5 minutes, then flip over to other side and bake for another 5 minutes, or until they are golden and firm. Transfer them to racks and cool to room temperature.

Storing: Because they are dry and they're fine if they get even drier, the biscotti will keep at room temperature, covered or not, for about a week. They can be frozen, but I rarely store them that way--mostly because they rarely last long enough to get wrapped up for long-term storage.

* original recipe uses 1/2 cup cornmeal, didn't have any used 1/2 cup semolina flour
* used earth balance vegan butter

# 12/09/18
* made with butter this time - made a substatail firm log
* added cherries 1/4 cup as recipe states, could double easily for sour flavor and density.
* start cuts with serrated knife, finish with chefs to get clean cuts.

# 12/12/18
* Added 3/4 cup of dried cherries, modified recipe - better wih more tartness since the dough is so sweet

# 12/31/18
* Using Earth Balance butter results in a flatter cookie.
